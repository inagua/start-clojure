Some Clojure experiments
===

These are some attemps to learn Clojure by answering
"Exercises of the ANSI Common Lisp book (Paul Graham, Prentice Hall)"  
Taken from [http://github.com/kototama/ansicommonlisp-book-clojure.git](http://github.com/kototama/ansicommonlisp-book-clojure.git)

I did not fork this repo cause I want to play with other things as well.
